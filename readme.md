This is an extension for Google Chrome that is made to interact with Reverb.com.  While browsing through pages of listings, running the extension (you have to click the "R" extension icon to run it on each new page) executes a script that hits Reverb's API to check price guide data for each listing on the page.  The script then changes the color of each price: green for a good deal, red for bad, yellow for ok, and black if the item isn't found in the price guide.

What am I considering a "good" or "bad" deal, you ask?  Well, from the price guide data, we get what Reverb considers the "top" and "bottom" prices for each item, and we can assume that most listing prices will fall somewhere in this range.  I take this range and split it in to thirds.  Bottom third of the range or lower is a good deal, top third or higher is a bad deal, middle third is an ok deal.  I may go back and subdivide the ranges more at some point, but I'll keep it simple for now.
